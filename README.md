# My-Tiktok-Data-Analysis
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.

# Description
I am Bahar SayÄ±nalp (32296) and my project is about analyzing my TikTok usage data to uncover patterns and correlations;


  -How the time of the day affects my tiktok usage time.
  
  -How the type of day affects my tiktok usage. 
  
  -How my productivity levels are correlated with time spent on tiktok.

This project aims to identify trends and insights into how TikTok usage influences my daily habits and overall productivity.

# Motivation
I use Tiktok often throughout the day. Therefore, I want to see how much it has an impact on my life.

# Data Resources
The primary dataset for this project is my TikTok usage data, which I will download directly from the app. This data set includes timestamped activity logs, providing details about the time spent on tiktok, login history, type of content I engage with etc.

My secondary dataset will be measurements of the time I spend on GoodNotes app, which I use for studying. This database will provide information about my productivity levels daily. Comparing these two datasets will help me to see if my productivity is correlated with my Tiktok usage.
  
# Plan
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Export TikTok usage data in JSON or CSV format.  
   - Log productivity data from the GoodNotes app.  

2. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Clean and preprocess the TikTok data to extract useful features.  
   - Merge the TikTok dataset with productivity logs to enable correlation analysis.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Use visualizations (e.g., histograms, heatmaps) to analyze daily and weekly TikTok usage trends.  
   - Calculate correlation metrics to assess relationships between productivity levels and TikTok usage.  

# Expectation
I aim to find patterns in my Tiktok usage. Moreover, I hope to decide whether Tiktok lowers my productivity levels. My goal is to gain a clear insight and try to optimize my life according to the outcomes I am going to find due to these datasets.
